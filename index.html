    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p class="fade-in spaced-text">This is a comprehensive proposal for the establishment of a Western-style school in Busia, Kenya. This unique educational institution aims to provide high-quality education to 1500 children through a collaborative effort between teachers from different European countries and Kenyan educators. The school's establishment and ongoing operational costs will be financed through the selling of electricity generated by a 30MW-40MW solar power plant, complemented by a 10MW battery storage system, which will be controlled by a trust</p>
    <p class="fade-in spaced-text">1. Introduction: Busia, Kenya, is a community filled with enthusiastic and motivated children who deserve access to world-class education. Our proposal is centered around the establishment of a Western-style school that combines the best practices from European educational systems with the local expertise of Kenyan teachers. This unique collaboration will create a dynamic learning environment that nurtures cultural exchange, fosters global perspectives, and promotes academic excellence.</p>
    <p class="fade-in spaced-text">2. School Infrastructure: The proposed school will feature state-of-the-art facilities, including modern classrooms, well-equipped laboratories, libraries, computer labs, sports fields, and recreational areas. The design will be inspired by Western educational standards while incorporating elements that reflect the local Kenyan culture and identity. The infrastructure will be designed to create an inspiring and conducive environment for learning.</p>
    <p class="fade-in spaced-text">3. Teachers and Staff: The school's faculty will consist of a diverse mix of highly qualified teachers from different European countries and Kenyan educators. This collaboration will offer a unique opportunity for cultural exchange and the sharing of pedagogical approaches. The teachers will work collaboratively, leveraging their respective strengths to deliver a holistic and well-rounded education to the students.</p>
